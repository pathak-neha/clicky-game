## Spongebob Squarepants Clicky Game
[Clicky](https://pathak-neha.github.io/clicky-game "View Live!") is a game to test your memory.

To begin the game, click on a card. But be careful! Remember which character you clicked on. The rules are as follows:
- Each card has a different character from Spongebob Squarepants on its face.
- Every time you click on a card, the deck shuffles, and each card is now placed in a randomly assigned spot on the board.
- To win, click on each card _only once_.
- Click on a card more than one time, and your score resets.
